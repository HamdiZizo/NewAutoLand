MetaGPT is revolutionizing the way we approach software development by introducing a multi-agent framework that simulates a complete software company workflow. In this guide, we'll walk through the basics of getting started with MetaGPT.

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, make sure you have:
- Python 3.9 or higher installed
- OpenAI API key
- Basic understanding of software development concepts

## Installation

Installing MetaGPT is straightforward using pip:

```bash
pip install metagpt
```

You'll also need to set up your environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

## Your First MetaGPT Project

Let's create a simple todo list application. Here's how to get started:

```python
from metagpt.roles import ProductManager, Architect, ProjectManager, Engineer
from metagpt.team import Team

# Initialize the team
team = Team()
team.hire([
    ProductManager(),
    Architect(),
    ProjectManager(),
    Engineer()
])

# Start the project
team.run("Create a simple todo list application with basic CRUD operations")
```

## Understanding the Output

MetaGPT will generate several key documents:
1. PRD (Product Requirements Document)
2. System Architecture Design
3. Task Breakdown
4. Implementation Code

Each document is created by a different role in the team, simulating real-world software development processes.

## Best Practices

When working with MetaGPT:
- Be specific with your requirements
- Review and validate each stage of output
- Iterate on the results if needed
- Keep your prompts clear and focused

## Next Steps

As you become more comfortable with MetaGPT, you can:
- Customize agent behaviors
- Add new roles to the team
- Integrate with your existing workflow
- Contribute to the open-source project
